# Blogs #
Our intention is to design a blog platform, which stores the data of the blog user information, the blog centent and comments, subscription information and administration information.

## Aspects ##
We will focus on blog users, including their registration information (username, password, age, birthdate), their subscripts (like music  blogs music under the “Music Fan Community, the blogs they have posted, and the comments they post below each blog. There will be different kinds of blogs, and users can comment and subscribe to these bloges.

Users will be able to set their password, email and a security question, and they can retrieve the password by answering the security question.
There will be two different sets that can access the platform: the user and the administrator. The user will be able to access their blogs (including post, modify and delete the blogs), viewing other’s blogs.  The administrator will monitor the community and will be able to delete (bad) blogs/comments and change the ban status of each user.

There will be two kinds of users, the general user and the vip user. The VIP user account has more functionalities, for example they can create folders and save their favorite posts into the folder.

The project will be held on a website. The front-end construction will involve HTML, CSS. We choose to use PHP and Oracle as our database management system. We will use the department Oracle server for SQL.
